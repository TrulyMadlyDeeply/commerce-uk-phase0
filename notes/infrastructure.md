Cloudflare Pages continues to display the original GitHub repository name
(trulymadlydeeply-site) due to a known Cloudflare UI limitation.

The live Pages project is correctly bound to the renamed repository
commerce-uk-phase0, as evidenced by successful deployments and commit
hashes. No action required.
