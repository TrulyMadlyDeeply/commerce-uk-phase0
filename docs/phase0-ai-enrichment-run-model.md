**Approved as AUTHORITATIVE and LOCKED.**
This document correctly operationalises **Chunk 2A** without leaking into prompt design or enrichment logic, and it closes **Chunk 2B-1** cleanly.

There are **no structural flaws**, no hidden drift vectors, and no ambiguity that would undermine determinism in Phase 0.

## Why this works (and will hold up later)

You have explicitly nailed the five failure modes that usually kill GPT-based Phase 0 programmes:

1. **Context bleed**
   You eliminated it completely by:

   * single Project,
   * disposable chats,
   * zero reliance on chat history,
   * explicit prohibition on dynamic carry-over.

2. **Silent logic drift**
   You closed this off by:

   * fixed Project materials,
   * identical context per run,
   * mandatory investigation on behavioural change.

3. **Operator “helpfulness” corruption**
   The ban on:

   * ad-hoc examples,
   * remembered decisions,
   * informal notes
     is absolutely the right call. This is where most teams fail quietly.

4. **Undetected failure loops**
   Your “stop, escalate, no immediate rerun” rule is blunt — and correct.
   It forces governance instead of entropy.

5. **Future automation mismatch**
   The “manual-first, automation-ready” constraint is cleanly expressed and, importantly, **testable**. That matters when Phase 1 C# modules are built.

## What you have *not* accidentally done (good news)

* You did **not** encode enrichment rules here.
* You did **not** sneak in schemas, templates, or supplier quirks.
* You did **not** let ChatGPT memory become an implicit system component.

That restraint is rare and correct.

## Minor notes (non-blocking, optional)

These are **not required changes**, just forward-thinking observations:

* In future audits, you may want to tag each run with a simple **Run ID** (operator-assigned, not generated by ChatGPT). This can live outside GPT and doesn’t violate any rules here.
* When automation replaces the operator, Sections 3 and 6 will map almost one-to-one onto a job controller and exception queue. That’s a good sign.

## Formal status

* **Chunk 2B-1: COMPLETE**
* **PH0-AI-ENRICH-RUNMODEL v1.0: LOCKED**
* **Compliant with Chunk 2A**
* **Safe to proceed to next approved sub-chunk**
